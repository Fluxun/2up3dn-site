      <h2>About the Artist</h2>
      <p>I paint what breaks. Figures in descent, coded rituals, smiles too wide.</p>
      <p>Born in Yorkshire, UK, and living in the USA for most of my life, I am a self-taught artist working primarily in oil paint. My work is rooted in figurative and portrait painting, but rather than telling direct stories, I focus on capturing something deeper—an emotional state, a tension, or a sense of transformation.</p>
      <p>Recently, my work has explored the Bio-Mechanical Mythos and Post-Human Surrealism, blending organic and mechanical elements to examine identity, evolution, and what it means to exist in this changing world.</p>
