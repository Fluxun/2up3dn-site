      <h1>Late Night Code Breaking</h1>

      <p>I took a break. I always do. Indeterminate length. I paint when I feel it. When I don’t, I don’t. But even when I’m not painting, I try to move things forward.</p>

      <p>My own gallery, by my own hands — every button, every glitch, every late-night curse at broken code — all of it. It’s art-adjacent. It’s me still pushing the myth forward, even if the brush isn’t wet.</p>

      <p>The only physical piece I finished during that downtime was a charcoal — a retirement gift for someone at the day job. That liminal world where “real life” lives. I think it came out alright. Soft, respectful. More human than I felt while making it.</p>

      <img src="images/charcoal-retirement.jpg" alt="Charcoal Portrait - Retirement Gift">

      <p>And I’ve been circling the studio again. The two oils I’ve been wrestling with — they’re both loud in my head again.</p>

      <img src="images/smile.jpg" alt="Smile WIP">
      <p><strong>Smile, and the world laughs at you</strong> – WIP, Oil on Canvas</p>

      <img src="images/limbo.jpg" alt="Limbo WIP">
      <p><strong>Limbo</strong> – WIP, Oil on Canvas with square motif</p>

      <p>These are the ones I feel pressing. Urgent. Needing out. The others are just keeping quiet company in the dark, watching, waiting their turn.</p>

      <img src="images/yearn.jpg" alt="Yearn WIP">
      <p><strong>Yearn</strong> – WIP, Oil on Masonite</p>

      <img src="images/glow.jpg" alt="Glow WIP">
      <p><strong>Glow</strong> – WIP, Oil on Masonite</p>

      <p>Not rushing it. But I feel the pull again. Time to move.</p>

      <h2>Poll?</h2>
      <p>Thinking of adding a poll here—let folks vote on which piece I should finish next. Low-tech. Simple. Maybe just a button and a tally. No promises. But I like the idea of a signal in the dark.</p>

      <h2>Gallery Season</h2>
      <p>It’s that time again. Thinking about submitting to a few shows. There’s a black and white show at Art in the Couv I’ve got my eye on. Some of the charcoals might belong there. Might be time to let them out into the wild.</p>
