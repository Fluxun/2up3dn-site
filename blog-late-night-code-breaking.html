    <h1>Late Night Code Breaking</h1>

    <p>I took a break. I always do. Indeterminate, necessary. I paint when I feel it — and when I don’t, I don’t.</p>

    <p>But even then, I was building. The site you’re on now? Mine. Every pixel, every button, every late-night curse at broken code. Still part of the mythos. Still forward motion.</p>

    <p>The only physical piece I finished in that downtime was this charcoal — a retirement gift for someone from the day job. That weird liminal place where "real life" lives. It came out human. Softer than I felt while drawing it.</p>

    <p class="caption"><strong>Charcoal Portrait</strong> – Retirement Gift</p>

    <p>But lately... I feel the pull again. The itch. The crawl under the skin that says “pick up the brush.”</p>

    <p>These are the pieces looming now — WIPs that demand finishing:</p>

    <img src="images/smile.jpg" alt="Smile WIP">
    <p class="caption"><strong>Smile, and the world laughs at you</strong> – WIP, Oil on Canvas</p>

    <img src="images/limbo.jpg" alt="Limbo WIP">
    <p class="caption"><strong>Limbo</strong> – WIP, Oil on Canvas</p>

    <img src="images/yearn.jpg" alt="Yearn WIP">
    <p class="caption"><strong>Yearn</strong> – WIP, Oil on Masonite</p>

    <img src="images/glow.jpg" alt="Glow WIP">
    <p class="caption"><strong>Glow</strong> – WIP, Oil on Masonite</p>

    <p>Not rushing it. But it’s time. I feel it.</p>

    <h2>Poll?</h2>
    <p>Thinking of adding a poll here — let folks vote on which piece I should finish next. Low-stakes feedback, but fun.</p>

    <p>Also, it’s gallery season. Might submit a few pieces. There’s a black-and-white show at Art in the Couv I’ve got my eye on. Some of the charcoals might find a home there.</p>
