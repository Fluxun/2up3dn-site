    <h1>Late Night Code Breaking</h1>

    <p>I took a break. I always do. Indeterminate length. I paint when I feel it, when I don’t, I don’t. But even during downtime, I try to stay orbiting the work. I built this website during one of those quiet spells — my own gallery, by my own hands — every button, every glitch, every late-night curse at broken code. It’s art-adjacent. It’s myth-building. Even if the brush wasn’t wet, the story moved forward.</p>

    <p>The only finished piece during that stretch was a charcoal — a retirement gift for someone at my day job. That liminal world where “real life” lives. It came out soft. More human than I felt while making it.</p>

    <h2>What’s Next</h2>

    <p>Here’s what’s been leaning against the easel lately — Work in Progress purgatory:</p>

    <img src="images/smile-wip.jpg" alt="Smile WIP">
    <p><strong>Smile</strong> – WIP, Oil on Canvas</p>

    <img src="images/limbo-wip.jpg" alt="Limbo WIP">
    <p><strong>Limbo</strong> – WIP, Oil on Canvas</p>

    <img src="images/yearn-wip.jpg" alt="Yearn WIP">
    <p><strong>Yearn</strong> – WIP, Oil on Masonite</p>

    <img src="images/glow-wip.jpg" alt="Glow WIP">
    <p><strong>Glow</strong> – WIP, Oil on Masonite</p>

    <p>Not rushing it. But I feel the pull again. Time to move.</p>

    <h2>Poll?</h2>
    <p>Thinking of adding a poll here—let folks vote on which piece I should finish next. Let me know if you’d use it.</p>
