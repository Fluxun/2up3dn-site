    <h1>Late Night Code Breaking</h1>
    <p>I always take breaks. Indeterminate lengths. I paint when I feel it—when I don’t, I don’t. But even in the off-time, I’m still moving the myth forward. That’s when the site came together. My own gallery, by my own hands—every button, every glitch, every late-night curse at broken code—all of it. It’s art-adjacent. Still the work.</p>

    <p>The only physical piece finished during that downtime was a charcoal portrait—a retirement gift for someone at the day job. That liminal space where "real life" lives. It came out soft, human. More human than I felt making it.</p>

    <p>It’s summer now. Gallery season. There’s a Black & White show at Art in the Couv I’m eyeing—thinking about submitting a couple charcoals. We’ll see.</p>

    <h2>Back to Paint</h2>
    <p>Something’s waking up again. The itch to paint is back. I’ve got a few on deck—half-done, half-haunted. These are next:</p>

    <p>Not rushing it. But I feel the pull again. Time to move.</p>

    <h2>Poll?</h2>
    <p>Thinking of adding a poll here—let folks vote on which piece I should finish next. Low-stakes. Just a way to share the process a bit more.</p>

    <p>More soon. Maybe even regularly.</p>
