    <h1>Late Night Code Breaking</h1>
    <p>I always take breaks. Indeterminate stretches where the brushes dry, and the studio lights stay off. But even then, I'm still building the myth.</p>

    <p>My own gallery, by my own hands — every button, every glitch, every late-night curse at broken code — all of it. It’s art-adjacent. It’s me still pushing the myth forward, even if the brush isn’t wet.</p>

    <p>The only physical piece I finished during that downtime was a charcoal — a retirement gift for someone at the day job. That liminal world where “real life” lives. I think it came out alright. Soft, respectful. More human than I felt while making it.</p>

    <img class="blog-image" src="images/retirement-gift-charcoal.jpg" alt="Charcoal Retirement Gift">

    <p>Now, I’m feeling it again.</p>
    <p>Two oils on deck — both WIPs. One’s working title is <strong>Smile, and the world laughs at you</strong>. The other’s just a square right now, but it’s called <strong>Limbo</strong>. Themes? Pressure. Containment. Humiliation. The usual.</p>

    <img class="blog-image" src="images/limbo-wip.jpg" alt="Limbo WIP">

    <p>I’ve also got two pieces on masonite. The large one is called <strong>Yearn</strong>. The tall one with the halo? That’s <strong>Glow</strong>. Both still breathing, still waiting.</p>

    <p>Not rushing it. But I feel the pull again. Time to move.</p>

    <div class="poll-header">Poll?</div>
    <p>Thinking of adding a poll here—let folks vote on which piece I should finish next. Let me know if you’d use it.</p>

    <p>Also—it's gallery season. Might try to get a few charcoals into a local black-and-white show. We'll see if I can be arsed.</p>
