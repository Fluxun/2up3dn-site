    <h1>Late Night Code Breaking</h1>

    <p>I always take breaks. Indeterminate ones. I paint when I feel it. When I don’t, I don’t. But even during those stretches, I’ve never really stepped away. I built this site during one of those painting droughts. My own gallery, by my own hands — every button, every glitch, every late-night curse at broken code — all of it. It’s art-adjacent. It’s me still pushing the myth forward, even if the brush isn’t wet.</p>

    <p>The only physical piece I finished during that time was this charcoal — a retirement gift for a friend at the day job. That liminal world where “real life” lives.</p>

    <p>I think it came out alright. Soft. Respectful. More human than I felt while making it.</p>

    <p>But the itch is back. That hum in the gut that says: *time to finish things.* These are what I’m circling now:</p>

    <h2>WIPs</h2>

        <h3>Smile, and the world laughs at you <span class="wip">(WIP)</span></h3>
        <p class="details">Oil on Canvas – Yellow tones, bleak grin, working through.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="artwork">

        <h3>Limbo <span class="wip">(WIP)</span></h3>
        <p class="details">Oil on Canvas – That orange square. That silent scream. That holding-it-in.</p>

        <h3>Yearn <span class="wip">(WIP)</span></h3>
        <p class="details">Oil on Masonite – Large, white, brittle. The ache sits heavy.</p>

        <h3>Glow <span class="wip">(WIP)</span></h3>
        <p class="details">Oil on Masonite – Long, vertical. A pale woman. A flickering halo.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>It’s also gallery season. There’s a Black & White show at Art in the Couv I’m eyeing — maybe one of the charcoals finds its way in. Maybe not. But I want to show again. To push the work out into the world.</p>

    <p>Question for anyone still reading: What should I finish next?</p>
    <p><strong>Poll incoming soon.</strong> Let’s see who wins — the ghost grinning in yellow or the square of silence.</p>

    <p>— Brownie</p>
